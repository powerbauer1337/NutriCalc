## Detailed Usability Issues

### Critical Issues

#### 1. Form Validation Gaps
**Component**: `SetupTab.tsx`, `SettingsPage.tsx`, `FertilizerManager.tsx`
**Description**: Several input fields lack proper validation, which can lead to incorrect data entry and calculation errors.
**Examples**:
- Water volume input in `SetupTab.tsx` accepts negative values despite having a `min="0.1"` attribute
- Custom water profile inputs in `SetupTab.tsx` don't validate for reasonable ranges
- API key input in `SettingsPage.tsx` doesn't validate format before saving

**Recommendations**:
- Implement client-side validation with clear error messages
- Add visual indicators for invalid inputs
- Prevent form submission when validation fails

#### 2. Error Messaging Deficiencies
**Component**: `App.tsx`, `ChatBar.tsx`, `SettingsPage.tsx`
**Description**: Error messages are often generic and don't provide actionable information to users.
**Examples**:
- API errors in `App.tsx` show technical error codes rather than user-friendly messages
- Chat API errors don't guide users on how to resolve issues
- Form validation errors don't specify what needs to be corrected

**Recommendations**:
- Implement user-friendly error messages with actionable guidance
- Use appropriate error message placement near the relevant UI elements
- Provide specific instructions for resolving common errors

### Major Issues

#### 3. User Flow Bottlenecks
**Component**: `SetupTab.tsx`, `FertilizerManager.tsx`, `WaterInput.tsx`
**Description**: Complex workflows require too many steps or lack clear progression indicators.
**Examples**:

## Accessibility Gaps

### Critical Issues

#### 1. Focus Management Issues
**Component**: `Navigation.tsx`, `FertilizerManager.tsx`, `WaterInput.tsx`
**Description**: Focus management is inconsistent, particularly in dynamic components.
**Examples**:
- Focus is not properly managed when adding/removing water sources
- Modal dialogs don't trap focus
- Dynamic content updates don't announce changes to screen readers

**Recommendations**:
- Implement proper focus trapping for modal dialogs
- Maintain focus order when dynamically adding/removing elements
- Use ARIA live regions for dynamic content updates

#### 2. Screen Reader Label Deficiencies
**Component**: `SetupTab.tsx`, `WaterInput.tsx`, `FertilizerManager.tsx`
**Description**: Many interactive elements lack proper labels for screen readers.
**Examples**:
- Custom water profile inputs use generic labels
- Fertilizer amount inputs don't specify which fertilizer they relate to
- Remove buttons don't indicate what they will remove

**Recommendations**:
- Add descriptive `aria-label` attributes to all interactive elements
- Use `aria-labelledby` to associate labels with form controls
- Implement proper heading structure for screen reader navigation

### Major Issues

#### 3. ARIA Implementation Gaps
**Component**: `Navigation.tsx`, `Card.tsx`, `Button.tsx`
**Description**: ARIA attributes are inconsistently implemented across components.
**Examples**:
- Navigation component uses `role="tablist"` but doesn't implement all required ARIA attributes
- Cards lack semantic structure for screen readers
- Buttons don't consistently use `aria-pressed` for toggle states

**Recommendations**:
- Implement complete ARIA patterns for all interactive components
- Use semantic HTML elements where possible instead of ARIA
- Test with screen readers to ensure proper announcements

#### 4. Keyboard Navigation Barriers
**Component**: `Navigation.tsx`, `FertilizerManager.tsx`, `WaterInput.tsx`
**Description**: Keyboard navigation is incomplete in several areas of the application.
**Examples**:
- Some interactive elements are not reachable via keyboard
- Focus indicators are not visible in all components
- Keyboard shortcuts are not documented

**Recommendations**:
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Implement visible focus indicators for all focusable elements
- Document keyboard navigation patterns in user documentation

### Minor Issues

#### 5. Color Contrast Insufficiencies
**Component**: `ToastMessage.tsx`, `SettingsPage.tsx`
**Description**: Some text elements don't meet WCAG AA contrast requirements.
**Examples**:
- Toast message text on certain backgrounds
- Secondary text in settings panel

**Recommendations**:
- Audit all color combinations for WCAG compliance
- Adjust colors to meet minimum contrast requirements
- Implement automated contrast checking in development workflow

#### 6. Missing Skip Links
**Component**: `App.tsx`, `Navigation.tsx`
**Description**: Users navigating with keyboards cannot skip repetitive content.
**Examples**:
- No skip link to main content
- No skip link to navigation

**Recommendations**:
- Implement skip links at the beginning of the page
- Ensure skip links are visible when focused
- Test skip link functionality with keyboard-only navigation
