# 1. Title: PRD for NutriCalc (Cannabis DÃ¼ngerrechner Pro)

<version>1.0.0</version>

## Status: Draft

## Intro

NutriCalc is an advanced nutrient calculator for plants (especially cannabis), designed as a single-page application (SPA) with React and Tailwind CSS. It enables precise calculation of nutrient solutions, management of custom fertilizers, and features an AI-powered assistant for user support. This PRD defines the goals, requirements, and development plan for the project.

## Goals

- Provide accurate nutrient solution calculations for various plant growth phases and water types
- Allow users to manage and customize fertilizer data
- Offer visual analysis and optimization recommendations
- Integrate an AI assistant for contextual help and guidance
- Ensure a responsive, user-friendly, and secure application

## Features and Requirements

- Functional requirements:
  - Nutrient calculation based on water amount, phase, and water type
  - Fertilizer database with add/edit/delete for custom fertilizers
  - Growth phase profiles with NPK/EC targets
  - Visual analysis (charts, tables, recommendations)
  - Import/export of recipes (JSON)
  - Dark mode and responsive design
  - AI chat assistant (Google Gemini API)
- Non-functional requirements:
  - SPA, fast load, no build step required
  - Secure API key management for AI
  - Open source (MIT License)
- User experience requirements:
  - Intuitive UI, clear feedback, error handling
  - Mobile and desktop usability
- Integration requirements:
  - Google Gemini API for AI chat
- Compliance requirements:
  - No sensitive data stored client-side
