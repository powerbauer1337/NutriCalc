- User understands the purpose of each tab
- User can complete basic setup without help
- User finds the interface visually appealing

### Scenario 2: Core Functionality Testing
**Objective**: Test primary use cases

**Tasks**:
1. Set up water volume and growth stage
2. Add fertilizers and adjust amounts
3. View calculated nutrient results
4. Export the configuration
5. Use the AI assistant for recommendations

**Success Metrics**:
- All tasks completed within expected timeframes
- No confusion about form inputs or buttons
- Results are clearly displayed and understood
- Export/import functions work intuitively

### Scenario 3: Mobile Experience
**Objective**: Validate responsive design

**Tasks**:
1. Access application on mobile device
2. Navigate using bottom navigation
3. Complete nutrient calculation on mobile
4. Test form inputs and interactions

**Success Metrics**:
- Navigation is easily accessible with thumbs
- All content is readable without zooming
- Touch targets are appropriately sized
- No horizontal scrolling required

### Scenario 4: Accessibility Testing
**Objective**: Ensure inclusive design

**Tasks**:
1. Navigate using only keyboard
2. Test with screen reader (if available)
3. Verify color contrast and readability
4. Test with different zoom levels

**Success Metrics**:
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Focus indicators are clearly visible
- Content is readable at 200% zoom
- Color is not the only means of conveying information

## Testing Protocol

### Pre-Test Setup
1. **Prepare test environment**

   - Explain next steps

#### Observation Guidelines
- **Record user actions** and verbal feedback
- **Note hesitations** and confusion points
- **Track completion times** for each task
- **Document error recovery** attempts
- **Observe emotional reactions** to design elements

### Post-Test Analysis

#### Quantitative Metrics
- **Task completion rates** by scenario
- **Time to completion** for each task
- **Error rates** and types
- **Satisfaction scores** (1-5 scale)
- **System Usability Scale (SUS)** scores

#### Qualitative Analysis
- **Common pain points** across users
- **Positive feedback themes**
- **Accessibility barriers** identified
- **Design preference patterns**
- **Feature request frequency**

## Feedback Collection

### Real-Time Feedback
```javascript
// Embedded feedback widget (conceptual)
const feedbackWidget = {
  triggers: ['task-completion', 'error-encounter', 'session-end'],
  questions: [
    'How easy was this task? (1-5)',
    'What confused you most?',
    'What did you like best?',
    'Any suggestions for improvement?'
  ]
};
```

### Post-Session Survey
1. **Overall satisfaction** (1-5 scale)
2. **Visual design rating** (1-5 scale)
3. **Ease of use rating** (1-5 scale)
4. **Likelihood to recommend** (1-10 scale)
5. **Most/least favorite features**
6. **Comparison to previous version** (if applicable)

### Continuous Feedback
- **In-app feedback button** for ongoing collection
- **Analytics tracking** of user behavior patterns
- **Support ticket analysis** for common issues
- **Community forum monitoring** for user discussions

## Success Measurement
