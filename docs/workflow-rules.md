## 2024-06-10 UI Redesign Plan & Progress

### Rationale
- The UI will be redesigned to improve clarity, accessibility, visual appeal, and user experience, following modern best practices and research-backed guidelines ([UX Design Institute](https://www.uxdesigninstitute.com/blog/guide-to-the-ui-design-process/)).
- The redesign will be incremental, focusing on high-impact, low-risk changes first, and will prioritize user-centered design, accessibility, and consistency.

### Redesign Strategy
- **Goals:**
  - Enhance clarity, accessibility, and visual appeal
  - Make navigation and flows more intuitive
  - Ensure mobile and desktop parity
  - Add micro-interactions for feedback
  - Document and communicate changes to users
- **Key Areas:**
  - Navigation (sidebar/bottom nav, clear active states)
  - Visual hierarchy (color, size, spacing)
  - Component consistency (design system for buttons, cards, inputs)
  - Accessibility (contrast, focus, ARIA labels)
  - Feedback (toasts, loading, animations)
  - Settings & personalization
  - Help & references
- **Incremental Rollout:**
  - Prioritize high-impact, low-risk changes
  - Test and gather feedback
  - Communicate changes and allow gradual adaptation
