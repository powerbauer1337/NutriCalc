### ðŸš¨ Critical Issues (Must Fix Immediately)

#### Type Safety Issues (49 TypeScript/ESLint errors)
- **Type Definitions**: Missing/incorrect interfaces for core types
- **API Integration**: Incorrect type handling in contexts
- **Component Props**: Many components missing proper TypeScript interfaces
- **Any Types**: 20+ instances of `any` type usage (against strict guidelines)

#### Test Suite Issues
- **Failed Tests**: 2/7 tests failing due to design system changes
- **Playwright Configuration**: E2E tests misconfigured
- **Coverage**: Insufficient test coverage for critical components

#### Code Quality Issues
- **Console Statements**: 6 console.log/error statements in production code
- **Unused Imports**: Multiple unused variables and imports
- **Missing Components**: SettingsPage component referenced but not found

## Immediate Action Plan (Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Critical Bug Fixes (Days 1-2)
1. **Fix TypeScript Errors**

   - Improve accessibility (ARIA labels, focus management)

2. **Navigation Enhancement**
   - Implement improved navigation with active states
   - Better mobile responsiveness
   - Keyboard navigation improvements

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement React.memo for expensive components
   - Add useCallback/useMemo where needed
   - Optimize bundle size

### Phase 3: Feature Enhancements (Days 6-10)
1. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Implement proper error boundaries
   - Better user feedback for API errors
   - Graceful degradation strategies

2. **Advanced UI Features**
   - Micro-interactions and animations
   - Improved loading states
   - Better responsive design

3. **Testing Expansion**
   - Increase test coverage to >80%
   - Add accessibility tests
   - Performance testing setup

## Development Priorities by Component

### Immediate (This Week)
```
1. Fix all TypeScript errors                 [CRITICAL]
2. Update failing tests                      [CRITICAL]  
3. Remove console statements                 [HIGH]
4. Implement SettingsPage component          [HIGH]
5. Apply design system to Navigation        [HIGH]
```

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)
```
1. Complete UI redesign Phase 1              [MEDIUM]
2. Add error boundaries                      [MEDIUM]
3. Improve accessibility compliance          [MEDIUM]
4. Performance optimization                  [MEDIUM]
5. Expand test coverage                      [LOW]
```

### Long Term (Next Month)
```
1. Advanced animations and micro-interactions [LOW]
2. PWA enhancements                          [LOW]
3. Advanced analytics integration            [LOW]
4. Internationalization support              [LOW]
```

## Technical Debt Assessment

### High Priority Technical Debt
- **Type Safety**: Extensive use of `any` types
- **Error Handling**: Inconsistent error handling patterns
- **Component Structure**: Some components lack proper separation of concerns
- **Test Coverage**: Insufficient coverage for critical paths

### Medium Priority Technical Debt
- **Performance**: Some unnecessary re-renders
- **Bundle Size**: Could be optimized further
- **Accessibility**: Missing ARIA labels in several components
- **Documentation**: Component documentation needs improvement

### Low Priority Technical Debt
- **Code Organization**: Some utility functions could be better organized
- **Styling**: Some hardcoded values that should use design system
- **Configuration**: Build configuration could be optimized

## Quality Gates

### Before Any New Feature
- [ ] All TypeScript errors resolved
- [ ] All tests passing (unit + E2E)
- [ ] ESLint warnings < 5
- [ ] No console statements in production code
- [ ] New code has proper type definitions

### Before Release
- [ ] Test coverage >80% for utils, >70% for components
- [ ] Accessibility audit passed
- [ ] Performance audit (Lighthouse score >90)
- [ ] Security audit clean
- [ ] Bundle size within limits

## Success Metrics

### Code Quality Metrics
- TypeScript errors: 0 (currently 49)
- ESLint warnings: <5 (currently 30)
- Test coverage: >80% utils, >70% components
- Bundle size: <500KB gzipped

### User Experience Metrics
